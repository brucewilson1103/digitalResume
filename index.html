        <p class="helloworld">As a lifelong learner, I am both proud and fortunate enough to be involved in the field of education for the last
        several years. I have earned my undergraduate degree in Education from The Pennsylvania State University and had the luxury to experience growing up
        on my Grandfather's farm not too far from the University. Upon graduating, I moved to Fairfax, VA, where I was an
        instructor for 4 years and earned my masters degree in instructional technology. I then taught in New Jersey for 2 years
        after that, before moving into the field of Project Management. I learned a vast amount of business skills while working as a project
        manager in the NYC area for a year and a half. All of my past experiences have brought me to where I am today as a Web
        Developer.
        
        I am currently seeking employment as a front end develper and would love for the opportunity to speak with you about
        collaborating! Please feel free to explore the links to my work below, and reach out to me.</p>
